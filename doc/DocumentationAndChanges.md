## **Why?** 
The reason I chose these colours is because they are easy on the eyes and creates a neutral, modern look. It also makes the page look fresh, clean and many company's that I've look at included blue.  

## **How you plan to use it:**

I plan to use [#2F4057](https://www.google.com/search?q=%232f4057&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB984GB984&oq=%232f4057&aqs=chrome..69i57.6631j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on) for the navigation bar and text that has [#E6E8EB](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23e6e8eb&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB984GB984&oq=%23e6e8eb&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i30i395j69i60.11255j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on) as it's background.

I also want to do [#E6E8EB](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23e6e8eb&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB984GB984&oq=%23e6e8eb&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i30i395j69i60.11255j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on) as the main background and text that has [#2F4057](https://www.google.com/search?q=%232f4057&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB984GB984&oq=%232f4057&aqs=chrome..69i57.6631j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on) as it's background.

## **Font:**

*They will come from google fonts.*

[Text font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) Light 300.

[Price front](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Gothic) Extra-bold 800.

## **Why?** 
---
### **Fonts:**
I chose these fonts because they look simple and would fit the theme very nice.

---
### **Home page** 
I went for a simple look because I don't want everything to look crowded or messy.

---
### **Images**
- I chose these images from google for an example, they all come from Apple's company. Before the website get's published, it will have it's own.

---
### **Main page**
- On the main page, the bottom images woudn't fit. I tried to add the scroll bar but unfortunately I wasn't able to as it wouldn't work. Therefore I resized the images to fit.
- The navigation bar works and will take you to it's location.

---
### **Product page**
- Each image will take you to their product page.

---
### **The product pages**
- This page is how each product page will look like.
---

### **Contact**
- I decided to change my layout page a bit and added a able instead. It includes numbers and an email to contact us for any queries. Below the table, it includes different rage of social media links.
---
## **Images**
Each product image is made by the Apple company which I used for examples only and not for the actual product. I did edit and changed some of the images backgrounds and product colours.

## **Why:**
The reason I chose these colours is because green is associated with refreshment and is a dominant colour in nature. It makes people feel secure and gives a neutral look. They are also simple colours and won't make the page look overwhelmed.

## **How you plan to use it:**

- Main background colour is going to be [#F7FCF8](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23F7FCF8&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB984GB984&ei=mPbfYa6eCZqA8gKk85rQCA&ved=0ahUKEwiuyuzDuq71AhUagFwKHaS5BooQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=%23F7FCF8&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQAFgAYNwDaABwAHgAgAFZiAFZkgEBMZgBAKABAqABAcABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&safe=active&ssui=on),
- Navigation bar colour is going to be [#819C86](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23819c86&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB984GB984&oq=%23819c86&aqs=chrome..69i57.6745j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on). The colour will also be used for different backgrounds,
- Text is going to be black.


## **Font:**

*They will come from google fonts.*

[Main text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish) Extra-light 200 (information),

[Heading text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Acme#standard-styles) Regular 400.

# **What I chose:**
I chose the first design because I believe it has much better layout and colours. Design 1 gives customers more choices and options where as design 2 is the opposite; not a lot of options.
