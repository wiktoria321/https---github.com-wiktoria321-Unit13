# **Feedback:**

Firstly, I asked one of my friends on their opinions and what should've been improved.

**Heidi Evans, friend:** *"I really like both of the designs but I like design 1 better. I enjoy the blue colours more than green, it looks clean and well organised. The thing I would change is probabably adding a scroll bar and working buttons, it would really bring everything together more."*

**My response:** I do agree with Heidi's comment, so I added a small products link on the top left corner for now until I can get the buttons working.

I then asked a person online to give their opinion.

**Class mate:** *"Both designs look great, but design 2 could have had something added to make it look full. Overall I like design 1 more, it just looks much better and clean looking. However, I would have added some text or more information, possiply more text to make it look less blanc."*

**My response:** I do agree that design 2 could have had some more things added to it and added some more information/text, not much as I do want it to give a clean look. Next time I would possibly add more information to the products towards each page.

# **Testing:**

Test 1:

I tested my website features and checked if everything works on other devices. The navigation bar works great, but the image links didn't want to work. To fix this problem, I will look into my Visual Studio Code and check what the problem is.

Problem: It turns out the link that the images were linked to were connected to my account/profile file. I needed to delete the first part of the links just to remove the connection. Now, it works fine.

Test 2:

The navigation bar works, image links work and everything else too. Which means the website is fully functional and fulfilled it's purpose.
