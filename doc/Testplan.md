# **Testing:**

Test 1:

I have tested my website on different browsers to check if my features, loading and speed is efficience and overall checked if everything works. The navigation bar works great, but the image links didn't want to work. To fix this problem, I will look into my Visual Studio Code and check what the problem is.

Problem: It turns out the link that the images were linked to were connected to my account/profile file. I needed to delete the first part of the links just to remove the connection. Now, it works fine.

Test 2:

I have tested again and the navigation bar works, image links work and everything else too. Which means the website is fully functional and fulfilled it's purpose.

# More Testing:

Website layout and elements testing:
Spelling: Checked for spelling errors throughtout the web page in headers and other text bodies using a spell-checking tool.

Typography: The text is easily readable and has good contrast with the background. It's easy to distinguish between the different UI elements.

Consistency: The website is consistent with colours, fonts and other visual elements. All are working perfectly fine and efficient.

Images: The size of 2 bottom images on the home page need to increase in size because it looks out of place and odd, but the rest of the images look great and as planned. However, images that are supposed to act like buttons do not funtion well which I'm going to have to fix.

Behaviour of interactive elements: The buttons don't click as intended and aren't functioning, which needs to be automated. However, the hovers and clicks work as intended.

Fixing the problem: To fix the button situation, I'll update my CSS's and make it's functioning the way it's supposed to.

Update: I configured my CSS's and made the buttons function properly. The problem was my href and style coding which was incorrectly put.

Fixing the image size: To fix the image size situation, I'll open the images into a editor and resize them until I believe it's the right size.
Update: I took me 4 tries to resize the images until I was happy using befunky photo editor as it's easy to use.
